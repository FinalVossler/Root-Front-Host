# Questions:

1- How is the application complicated/confusing?
2- need guidance too
3- Is it possible to have group chats in discord?
5- Should I build the all in one PDF feature?
6- Workload and payment
7- Why do we need a SASS specialist
8- Why do we need Patrick
9- Any clients/testers yet?

# Things to clarify:

1- We need to move away from zoom

- Using google api to send emails in the backend
- contact@erikusa.com was made using google technologies
- Most of us have email on gmail, and we are receiving Erikusa's emails on gmail,

- So why not just continue on using google for meetings too?? (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)

2- All the tests I'm writing are for the CMS (The fundamental features of the app)

# Todos:

2- I'm going to have to finish writing all the tests
3- Back button on each micro-frontend (forecast, pestel, kpis)
